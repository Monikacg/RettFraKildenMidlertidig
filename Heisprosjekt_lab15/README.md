Note: The code in the folders inside the network folder (bcast, conn, localip, peers) and the entire Project-master folder was not created by us. It is code provided to us by the scientific assistants to operate the messaging over network using UDP and simulating elevators without having any available, respectively. No code in these files has been changed, nor has the README files that accompany them. Additional marking might be added at a later date, but for now this will suffice. This is because the purpose of this repository is mostly for us to have our code at hand when we change workplace, and the files we are using the scientific assistants are available on public repositories on this site.
